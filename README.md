# Tic-Tac-Toe Flask

This is a web-based Tic Tac Toe application that currently allows two clients to play against each other.&#x20;

You can only run this project through flask currently but in the future it will be a separate website you can visit, hopefully with a global leaderboard, P V P and P V Ai.

## Important!

Please ensure you have [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed before starting the installation

Please ensure when playing you open the local host link given by flask in two different browsers.
(Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000)

## Installation

Open your terminal/console and navigate to the github folder you just downloaded and paste the following

**LINUX**

```
cd Desktop/Tic-Tac-Toe-Web-master
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
flask run
```

**WINDOWS**
